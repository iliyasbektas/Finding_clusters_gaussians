```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

The main objective of this exercise is to design a simulation study in order to
compare the performance of different model selection techniques. Yes, seems vague. For more information, please read this file [here](https://github.com/iliyasbektas/SDS_HW2/blob/main/hw-02%20-%20(20201218).pdf). 

## Part 1.
## Extend my handmade code to get the EM-fit of a generic mixture of k > 1 (instead of just 2) Gaussians.

What is implied by 'my code' is a code in [this file]()
```{r}

```







```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
